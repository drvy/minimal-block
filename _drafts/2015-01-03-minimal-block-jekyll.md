This theme stared out being a fork from the [Block-log](https://github.com/anandubajith/block-log). It still keeps many similarities. Minimal-block is a minimalistic, responsive and friendly Jekyllrb theme. It has almost no javascript (except for disquss), static social share buttons, rss, paginator, clean and simple permalinks and RSS.

Setting up
----------------
To start you own blog, simply git clone the repository on github.

    git clone https://github.com/drvy/minimal-block.git

Once cloned, edit the `_config.yml` file at the root of the repository.

To add your own posts, add a file to the _posts directory. The file name has to follow the following structure.

    year-month-day-title.md
    2015-01-25-Hello-world.md

The post doesn't have to be writen in markdown but it's recomended. Notice that the URL of the post will contain the “Hello-world” part so the title of the file must be URL friendly.


Things to change in `_config.yml`
----------------
This file contains the configuration of your blog. By default, it looks like this:

    # General
    name: Minimal-Block
    description: "Minimalistic, friendly, responsive."
    url: http://localhost:4000

    markdown: redcarpet
    highlighter: pygments

    paginate: 5
    permalink: /:title

    # Social share and comments.
    disqus-id: yourusername
    twitter: yourusername
    github: yourusername
    google: +yourusername

    # RSS feed
    rss-feed-limit: 10
    rss-show-full: "yes"

You will need to change `name` , `url` , `twitter`, `disqus-id`, `google` and `github`. All others are optional. Here is what the variables mean.

<table>
<thead>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr><td>name</td><td>The name of your jekyll site. The title.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>description</td><td>Basic description. Sub-title.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>url</td><td>Where will be the jekyll site. The main URL without the endind / (slash).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>markdown</td><td>The preffered markdown parser to use.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>highlighter</td><td>The syntax-highlighter to use. If not set, `highlights.css` will not be included.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>paginate</td><td>How much posts to show per page.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>permalink</td><td>The friendly urls of the post. `none` is the jekyll default.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>disqus-id</td><td>The disqus ID. If not set, comments will not be shown.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>twitter</td><td>Your twitter username (used while sharing).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>github</td><td>Your github username.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>google</td><td>Youre google+ username.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>rss-feed-limit</td><td>How much entries to display in the feed.xml (rss).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>rss-show-full</td><td>The show the full post or to put only the excerpt (yes | no).</td></tr>
</tbody>

Writing posts.
----------------
Checkout the Jekyllrb [wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) for documentation on writing posts. This theme
makes use of static sharing buttons and they use a few tags that you should include in your posts.
An example of a post header:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "minimal-block - A minimalistic responsive Jekyll theme"
    date:   2015-01-25 00:00:00
    categories: jekyll, themes
    tags: jekyll, theme, minimal
    shortUrl: http://goo.gl/JhfZT9
    ---

Most of these variables are just the default ones but the last two (`tags` and `shortUrl`) are used by the theme when sharing via the social buttons in the end of every post.

Specifically, `tags` will be converted into hashtags when sharing on Twitter and if you supply a `shortUrl`, it will be used instead of the full url. This is useful if you are using [goo.gl](http://goo.gl) since they provide statistics for each short link and that way you can see how many people are sharing your post.


Pages and other files.
----------------
Each page has its own directory in the root folder of the theme. In each directory there is an index.html representing the contents of the page. Take a look at the default ones (about and contact) to see the structure.

Another file to know about is the `footer.html` as it has the copyright notice and credits. This file is located in the `_includes` folder. You can remove the credits if you want but I would love you if you give me some credit in the HTML source.

The `404` file is located in the root folder and it contains the exactly same structure as a page.
